// What I learned (Jasmine)
// The biggest thing that I learned about was the use of GitKraken and being able to view and manipulate the workflow.
// Another important thing I learned was about how to use and branches and merge pull request to collaborate with other people on Comp Sci projects
// Before my use of github was limited because I basically used it as an online code, storage locker 
// Now I understand how powerful a tool like Github is for project collaboration in the Comp Sci field, especially
// Lastly, I found the use of lambda notation to be very smart as well because it literally limited code volume to one line
// I will definitely implement this much more in my code from now on
// I feel that this project was very helpful as the final project because it taught me a real life skill that I will probably use in the near future
